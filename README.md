# Kythera Rust Starter Kit

Create wasm target and test actors to be tested with [Kythera].
This project contains the necessary logic to build actors for our [Kythera] toolset.

It was heavily inspired and copied from the implementation [over the `ref-fvm`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/tree/37643fc02f0342256afecff5158c43693b5ee4f0/testing/test_actors)
done by @fridrik01.

## Instructions

Clone this repository and look into the [actors](./actors/) and [tests](./tests/) dirs for examples on how to create both `Target` and `Test` actors.
